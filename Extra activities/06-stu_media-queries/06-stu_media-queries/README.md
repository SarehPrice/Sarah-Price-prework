# Media Queries

## Instructions:

Add more styling to the media query provided in `css/style.css` to create padding and margins for the two boxes when the page is below a `max-width` of 768px.

**Note:** This isn't easy. Just give it your best shot. Even if you don't get the exact solution, but are able to better understand how media queries work, that's a solid takeaway.

**Challenge:**

Add more styling to the CSS file such that the `@media screen` code adjusts the padding and width for the two boxes when the page is below a `max-width` of 980px.

**Hint:** Because CSS files are read from top to bottom, you want to make sure that your _larger_ media query widths are first, and _smaller_ media query widths come after.
